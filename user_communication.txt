So you want me to simulate the process using several formulas and display the results like shown in the figures in Chapter 2.
4:11 AM
And of course, using Matlab?
4:11 AM
T
yes, the results must be close to the simulation
4:12 AM

Of course I can do it.

We measure end-to-end performance analysis except for resource usage and waiting time only for one node MEC.
4:13 AM

What about the budget
4:14 AM
Of course I can do it. But it will take time. And deadline?
4:14 AM
T
If you send me a small part of the work that shows that the results are close to the simulation, you can take two days

I am afraid to say, but throughout the checking your project in document, I found that it would be a little complicated because of lack of communication knowledge.
4:17 AM
So $30 is not worth for me to do in 2 days.
4:17 AM
My hourly rate is at least $20.
4:18 AM
T
I want the total price?
4:19 AM

So how much are you going to pay if I finish this in 2 days?
4:19 AM
